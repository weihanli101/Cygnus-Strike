Weihan Li and David Chau's 2d Shooter

Discription:
Basics on how to make a seperate class(object) then reference it somewhere else

- although the scratch itself only uses two java files in core (the object (Alien.java), and the "somewhere else"(Main.java)
I pushed the whole project since I was lazy (weihan) still it is pretty cool stuff (not really).
